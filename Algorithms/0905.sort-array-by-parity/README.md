# [905. Sort Array By Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/)

## 题目

Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of `A`, followed by all the odd elements of `A`.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
```

Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 5000
- 0 <= A[i] <= 5000
