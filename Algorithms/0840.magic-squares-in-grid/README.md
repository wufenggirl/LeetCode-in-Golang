# [840. Magic Squares In Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/magic-squares-in-grid/)

## 题目

A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given an gridof integers, how many 3 x 3 "magic square" subgrids are there? (Each subgrid is contiguous).

Example 1:

```text
Input: [[4,3,8,4],
        [9,5,1,9],
        [2,7,6,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:
438
951
276

while this one is not:
384
519
762

In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.
```

Note:

1. 1 <= grid.length<= 10
1. 1 <= grid[0].length<= 10
1. 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15
