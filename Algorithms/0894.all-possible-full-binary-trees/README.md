# [894. All Possible Full Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/)

## 题目

A `full binary tree` is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with `N` nodes. Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each `node` of each tree in the answer must have node.Val = 0.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.

Example 1:

```text
Input: 7
Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
Explanation:
