# [870. Advantage Shuffle](https://leetcode.com/problems/advantage-shuffle/)

## 题目

Given two arrays A and B of equal size, the advantage of A with respect to B is the number of indices ifor which A[i] > B[i].

Return any permutation of A that maximizes its advantage with respect to B.

Example 1:

```text
Input: A = [2,7,11,15], B = [1,10,4,11]
Output: [2,11,7,15]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: A = [12,24,8,32], B = [13,25,32,11]
Output: [24,32,8,12]
```

Note:

1. 1 <= A.length = B.length <= 10000
1. 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
1. 0 <= B[i] <= 10^9
