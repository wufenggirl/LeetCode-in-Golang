# [391. Perfect Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-rectangle/)

## 题目

Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N > 0, determine if they all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point. For example, a unit square is represented as [1,1,2,2]. (coordinate of bottom-left point is (1, 1) and top-right point is (2, 2)).

Example 1:

```text
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [3,2,4,4],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,4]
]
Return true. All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
```

Example 2:

```text
rectangles = [
  [1,1,2,3],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [3,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.
```

Example 3:

```text
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [3,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because there is a gap in the top center.
```

Example 4:

```text
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [2,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.
```
