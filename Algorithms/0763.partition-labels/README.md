# [763. Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)

## 题目

A string S of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:

```text
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

Note:

1. S will have length in range [1, 500].
1. S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.
