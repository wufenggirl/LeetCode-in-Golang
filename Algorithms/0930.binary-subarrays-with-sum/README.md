# [930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

In an array A of 0s and 1s, how many non-empty subarrays have sum S?

Example 1:

```text
Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
Output: 4
Explanation:
The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

Note:

1. `A.length <= 30000`
1. `0 <= S <= A.length`
1. `A[i] is either 0 or 1.`
