# [313. Super Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-ugly-number/)

## 题目
Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.

Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k. For example, [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2, 7, 13, 19] of size 4.

Note:
1. 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
1. The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
1. 0 < k ≤ 100, 0 < n ≤ 106, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.
1. The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
