# [303. Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)

## 题目

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

Example:

```text
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```

Note:

1. You may assume that the array does not change.
1. There are many calls to sumRange function.
