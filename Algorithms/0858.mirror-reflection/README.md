## 题目

There isa special square room with mirrors on each of the fourwalls. Except for the southwestcorner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.

The square room has walls of length p, and a laser ray from the southwest cornerfirst meets the east wall at a distance qfrom the 0th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first. (It is guaranteed that the ray will meeta receptor eventually.)

Example 1:

```text
