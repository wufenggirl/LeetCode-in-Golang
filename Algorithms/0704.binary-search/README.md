# [704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

## 题目

Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array nums of n elements and a target value, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index, otherwise return -1.

Example 1:

```text
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

Note:

1. You may assume that all elements in nums are unique.
1. n will be in the range [1, 10000].
1. The value of each element in nums will be in the range [-9999, 9999].
