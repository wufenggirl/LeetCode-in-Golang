# [564. Find the Closest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/)

## 题目

Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.

The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example 1:

```text
Input: "123"
Output: "121"
```

Note:

1. The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
1. If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
