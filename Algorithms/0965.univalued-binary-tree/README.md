# [965. Univalued Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/univalued-binary-tree/)

A binary tree is univalued if every node in the tree has the same value.

Return true if and only if the given tree is univalued.

Example 1:

![ex1](ex1.png)

```text
Input: [1,1,1,1,1,null,1]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

![ex2](ex2.png)

```text
Input: [2,2,2,5,2]
Output: false
```

Note:

1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 100].
1. Each node's value will be an integer in the range [0, 99].
