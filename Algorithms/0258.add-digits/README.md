# [258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/)

## 题目

Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

```text
Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
