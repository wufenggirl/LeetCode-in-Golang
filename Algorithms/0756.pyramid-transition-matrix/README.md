# [756. Pyramid Transition Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/pyramid-transition-matrix/)

## 题目

We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string, like `'Z'`.

For every block of color `C` we place not in the bottom row, we are placing it on top of a left block of color `A` and right block of color `B`. We are allowed to place the block there only if `(A, B, C)` is an allowed triple.

We start with a bottom row of bottom, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples allowed. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3.

Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.

Example 1:

```text
Input: bottom = "XYZ", allowed = ["XYD", "YZE", "DEA", "FFF"]
Output: true
Explanation:
We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  D   E
 / \ / \
X   Y   Z

This works because ('X', 'Y', 'D'), ('Y', 'Z', 'E'), and ('D', 'E', 'A') are allowed triples.
```

Example 1:

```text
Input: bottom = "XXYX", allowed = ["XXX", "XXY", "XYX", "XYY", "YXZ"]
Output: false
Explanation:
We can't stack the pyramid to the top.
Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.
```

Note:

1. bottom will be a string with length in range [2, 8].
1. allowed will have length in range [0, 200].
1. Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}.
