# [1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/)

Given a positive integer K, you need find the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N.  If there is no such N, return -1.

Example 1:

```text
Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
```

Note:

- `1 <= K <= 10^5`
