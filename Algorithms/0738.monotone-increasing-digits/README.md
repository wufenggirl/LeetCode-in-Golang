# [738. Monotone Increasing Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/)

## 题目

Given a non-negative integer N, find the largest number that is less than or equal to N with monotone increasing digits.

(Recall that an integer has monotone increasing digits if and only if each pair of adjacent digits x and y satisfy x <= y.)

Example 1:

```text
Input: N = 10
Output: 9
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: N = 1234
Output: 1234
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: N = 332
Output: 299
```

Note: N is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
