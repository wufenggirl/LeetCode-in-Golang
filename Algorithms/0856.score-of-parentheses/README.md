# [856. Score of Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-parentheses/)

## 题目

Given a balanced parentheses string S, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:

- () has score 1
- AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
- (A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.

Example 1:

```text
Input: "()"
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: "(())"
Output: 2
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: "()()"
Output: 2
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: "(()(()))"
Output: 6
```

Note:

1. S is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
1. 2 <= S.length <= 50
