# [805. Split Array With Same Average](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-with-same-average/)

## 题目

In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)

Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.

```text
Example :
Input:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: true
Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have the average of 4.5.
```

Note:

1. The length of A will be in the range [1, 30].
1. A[i] will be in the range of [0, 10000].
