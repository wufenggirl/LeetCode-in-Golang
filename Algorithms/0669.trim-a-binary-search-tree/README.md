# [669. Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)

## 题目

Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as L and R, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [L, R] (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

Example 1:

```text
Input:
    1
   / \
  0   2

  L = 1
  R = 2

Output:
    1
      \
       2
```

Example 2:

```text
Input:
    3
   / \
  0   4
   \
    2
   /
  1

  L = 1
  R = 3

Output:
      3
     /
   2
  /
 1
 ```
