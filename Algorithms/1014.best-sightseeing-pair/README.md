# [1014. Best Sightseeing Pair](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-sightseeing-pair/)

Given an array A of positive integers, A[i] represents the value of the i-th sightseeing spot, and two sightseeing spots i and j have distance j - i between them.

The score of a pair (i < j) of sightseeing spots is (A[i] + A[j] + i - j) : the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, minus the distance between them.

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [8,1,5,2,6]
Output: 11
Explanation: i = 0, j = 2, A[i] + A[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11
```

Note:

- `2 <= A.length <= 50000`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 1000`
