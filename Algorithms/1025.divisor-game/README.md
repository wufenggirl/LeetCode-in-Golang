# [1025. Divisor Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/)

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

- Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
- Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Example 1:

```text
Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
```

Note:

1. `1 <= N <= 1000`
