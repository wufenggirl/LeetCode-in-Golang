# [470. Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-rand10-using-rand7/)

## 题目

Given a function rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function rand10which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

Do NOT use system's Math.random().

Example 1:

```text
Input: 1
Output: [7]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: 2
Output: [8,4]
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: 3
Output: [8,1,10]
```

Note:

1. rand7 is predefined.
1. Each testcase has one argument:n, the number of times that rand10 is called.

Follow up:

1. What is the expected valuefor the number of calls torand7()function?
1. Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?
