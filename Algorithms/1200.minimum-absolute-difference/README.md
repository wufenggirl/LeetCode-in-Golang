# [1200. Minimum Absolute Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference/)

Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows

- a, b are from arr
- a < b
- b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr

Example 1:

```text
Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: arr = [1,3,6,10,15]
Output: [[1,3]]
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: arr = [3,8,-10,23,19,-4,-14,27]
Output: [[-14,-10],[19,23],[23,27]]
```

Constraints:

- `2 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
