# [1037. Valid Boomerang](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-boomerang/)

A boomerang is a set of 3 points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

Given a list of three points in the plane, return whether these points are a boomerang.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: false
```

Note:

1. `points.length == 3`
1. `points[i].length == 2`
1. `0 <= points[i][j] <= 100`
