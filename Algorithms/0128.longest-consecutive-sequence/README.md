# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

## 题目
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
```
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
```

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
