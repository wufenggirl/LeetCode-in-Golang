## 题目

You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array.
The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:

```text
Given nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]

To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
```

Return the array [2, 1, 1, 0].
