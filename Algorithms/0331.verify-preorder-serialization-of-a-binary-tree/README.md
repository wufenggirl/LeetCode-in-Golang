# [331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/)

## 题目

One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as #.

```text
     _9_
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6
/ \ / \   / \
# # # #   # #
```

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node.

Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as "1,,3".

```text
Example 1:
"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Return true
Example 2:
"1,#"
Return false
Example 3:
"9,#,#,1"
Return false
```
