# [743. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/)

## 题目

There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

Note:

1. N will be in the range [1, 100].
1. K will be in the range [1, N].
1. The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
1. All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 1 <= w <= 100.
