# [665. Non-decreasing Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/)

## 题目

Given an array with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] <= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 <= i < n).

Example 1:

```text
Input: [4,2,3]
Output: True
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [4,2,1]
Output: False
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
```

Note: The n belongs to [1, 10,000].
