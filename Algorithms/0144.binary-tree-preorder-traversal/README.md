# [144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

## 题目
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.


For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
```

return [1,2,3].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
