# [416. Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/)

## 题目

Given a `non-empty` array containing `only positive integers`, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:

1. Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
1. The array size will not exceed 200.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```
