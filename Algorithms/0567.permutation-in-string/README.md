# [567. Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)

## 题目

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

Example 1:

```text
Input:s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output:True
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
```

Example 2:

```text
Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: False
```

Note:

1. The input strings only contain lower case letters.
1. The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].
