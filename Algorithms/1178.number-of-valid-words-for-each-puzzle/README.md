# [1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-words-for-each-puzzle/)

With respect to a given puzzle string, a word is valid if both the following conditions are satisfied:

- word contains the first letter of puzzle.
- For each letter in word, that letter is in puzzle.
- For example, if the puzzle is "abcdefg", then valid words are "faced", "cabbage", and "baggage"; while invalid words are "beefed" (doesn't include "a") and "based" (includes "s" which isn't in the puzzle).

Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the number of words in the given word list words that are valid with respect to the puzzle puzzles[i].

Example :

```text
Input:
words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"],
puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]
Output: [1,1,3,2,4,0]
Explanation:
1 valid word for "aboveyz" : "aaaa"
1 valid word for "abrodyz" : "aaaa"
3 valid words for "abslute" : "aaaa", "asas", "able"
2 valid words for "absoryz" : "aaaa", "asas"
4 valid words for "actresz" : "aaaa", "asas", "actt", "access"
There're no valid words for "gaswxyz" cause none of the words in the list contains letter 'g'.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 10^5`
- `4 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- `1 <= puzzles.length <= 10^4`
- `puzzles[i].length == 7`
- `words[i][j], puzzles[i][j] are English lowercase letters.`
- `Each puzzles[i] doesn't contain repeated characters.`
