# [145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

## 题目
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
```
return [3,2,1].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
