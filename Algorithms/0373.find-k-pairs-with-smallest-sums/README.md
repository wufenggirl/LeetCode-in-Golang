# [373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/)

## 题目

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k.

Define a pair (u,v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Find the k pairs (u1,v1),(u2,v2) ...(uk,vk) with the smallest sums.

```text
Example 1:
Given nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6],  k = 3

Return: [1,2],[1,4],[1,6]

The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence:
[1,2],[1,4],[1,6],[7,2],[7,4],[11,2],[7,6],[11,4],[11,6]

Example 2:
Given nums1 = [1,1,2], nums2 = [1,2,3],  k = 2

Return: [1,1],[1,1]

The first 2 pairs are returned from the sequence:
[1,1],[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2],[1,3],[1,3],[2,3]

Example 3:
Given nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3],  k = 3

Return: [1,3],[2,3]

All possible pairs are returned from the sequence:
[1,3],[2,3]
```
