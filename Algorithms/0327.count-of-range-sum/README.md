# [327. Count of Range Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/)

## 题目

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.

Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (`i` ≤ `j`), inclusive.

Note:
A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

Example:

```text
Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
Return 3.
The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
```
