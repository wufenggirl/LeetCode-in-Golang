# [1207. Unique Number of Occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/)

Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.

Example 1:

```text
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
