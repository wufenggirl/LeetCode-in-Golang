# [462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements-ii/)

## 题目

Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

Example:

```text
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
```
