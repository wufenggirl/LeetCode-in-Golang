# [347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

## 题目

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

For example,
Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].

Note:

1. You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
1. Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
