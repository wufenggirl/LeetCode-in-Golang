# [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

## 题目
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
1. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
1. and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number
```
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```
