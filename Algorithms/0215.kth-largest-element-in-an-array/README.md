# [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

## 题目
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

For example,
Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
