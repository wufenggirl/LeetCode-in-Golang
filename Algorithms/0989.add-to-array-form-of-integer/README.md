# [989. Add to Array-Form of Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-to-array-form-of-integer/)

For a non-negative integer X, the array-form of X is an array of its digits in left to right order.  For example, if X = 1231, then the array form is [1,2,3,1].

Given the array-form A of a non-negative integer X, return the array-form of the integer X+K.

Example 1:

```text
Input: A = [1,2,0,0], K = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: A = [2,7,4], K = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: A = [2,1,5], K = 806
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: 215 + 806 = 1021
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: A = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], K = 1
Output: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 9999999999 + 1 = 10000000000
```

Noteï¼š

- 1 <= A.length <= 10000
- 0 <= A[i] <= 9
- 0 <= K <= 10000
- If A.length > 1, then A[0] != 0
