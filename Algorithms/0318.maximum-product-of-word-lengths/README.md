# [318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/)

## 题目

Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters.
You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters.
If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:

```text
Given ["abcw", "baz", "foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"]
Return 16
The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
```

Example 2:

```text
Given ["a", "ab", "abc", "d", "cd", "bcd", "abcd"]
Return 4
The two words can be "ab", "cd".
```

Example 3:

```text
Given ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"]
Return 0
No such pair of words.
```
