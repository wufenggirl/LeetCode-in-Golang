# [1001. Grid Illumination](https://leetcode.com/problems/grid-illumination/)

On a N x N grid of cells, each cell (x, y) with 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N has a lamp.

Initially, some number of lamps are on.  lamps[i] tells us the location of the i-th lamp that is on.  Each lamp that is on illuminates every square on its x-axis, y-axis, and both diagonals (similar to a Queen in chess).

For the i-th query queries[i] = (x, y), the answer to the query is 1 if the cell (x, y) is illuminated, else 0.

After each query (x, y) [in the order given by queries], we turn off any lamps that are at cell (x, y) or are adjacent 8-directionally (ie., share a corner or edge with cell (x, y).)

Return an array of answers.  Each value answer[i] should be equal to the answer of the i-th query queries[i].

Example 1:

```text
Input: N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation:
Before performing the first query we have both lamps [0,0] and [4,4] on.
The grid representing which cells are lit looks like this, where [0,0] is the top left corner, and [4,4] is the bottom right corner:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Then the query at [1, 1] returns 1 because the cell is lit.  After this query, the lamp at [0, 0] turns off, and the grid now looks like this:
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Before performing the second query we have only the lamp [4,4] on.  Now the query at [1,0] returns 0, because the cell is no longer lit.
```

Note:

- `1 <= N <= 10^9`
- `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
- `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
- `lamps[i].length == queries[i].length == 2`
