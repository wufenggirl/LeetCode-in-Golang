# [668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-number-in-multiplication-table/)

## 题目

Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k, you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.

Example 1:

```text
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output:
Explanation:
The Multiplication Table:
1  2  3
2  4  6
3  6  9

The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output:
Explanation:
The Multiplication Table:
1  2  3
2  4  6

The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
```

Note:

The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
The k will be in the range [1, m * n]
