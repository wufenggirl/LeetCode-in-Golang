# [866. Prime Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-palindrome/)

## 题目

Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.

Recall that anumber is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1.

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 areprimes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

Example 1:

```text
Input: 6
Output: 7
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: 8
Output: 11
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: 13
Output: 101
```

Note:

1. 1 <= N <= 10^8
1. The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than 2 * 10^8.
