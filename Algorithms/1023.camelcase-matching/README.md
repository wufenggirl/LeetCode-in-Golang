# [1023. Camelcase Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/camelcase-matching/)

A query word matches a given pattern if we can insert lowercase letters to the pattern word so that it equals the query. (We may insert each character at any position, and may insert 0 characters.)

Given a list of queries, and a pattern, return an answer list of booleans, where answer[i] is true if and only if queries[i] matches the pattern.

Example 1:

```text
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FB"
Output: [true,false,true,true,false]
Explanation:
"FooBar" can be generated like this "F" + "oo" + "B" + "ar".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "F" + "oot" + "B" + "all".
"FrameBuffer" can be generated like this "F" + "rame" + "B" + "uffer".
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FoBa"
Output: [true,false,true,false,false]
Explanation:
"FooBar" can be generated like this "Fo" + "o" + "Ba" + "r".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "Fo" + "ot" + "Ba" + "ll".
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FoBaT"
Output: [false,true,false,false,false]
Explanation:
"FooBarTest" can be generated like this "Fo" + "o" + "Ba" + "r" + "T" + "est".
```

Note:

- 1 <= queries.length <= 100
- 1 <= queries[i].length <= 100
- 1 <= pattern.length <= 100
- All strings consists only of lower and upper case English letters.
