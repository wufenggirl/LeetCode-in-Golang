# [140. Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/)

## 题目
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Return all such possible sentences.

For example, given
```
s = "catsanddog",
dict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"].

A solution is ["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"].
```
UPDATE (2017/1/4):
The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
