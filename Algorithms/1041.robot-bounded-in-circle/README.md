# [1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/)

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot can receive one of three instructions:

- "G": go straight 1 unit;
- "L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
- "R": turn 90 degrees to the right.

The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

Example 1:

```text
Input: "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation:
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: "GG"
Output: false
Explanation:
The robot moves north indefinitely.
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: "GL"
Output: true
Explanation:
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...
```

Note:

1. `1 <= instructions.length <= 100`
1. `instructions[i] is in {'G', 'L', 'R'}`
