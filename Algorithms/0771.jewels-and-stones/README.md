# [771. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

## 题目

You‘re given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

```text
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

Note:

- S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- The characters in J are distinct.
