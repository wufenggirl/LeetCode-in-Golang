# [187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)

## 题目
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

For example,
```
Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
Return:
["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
```
