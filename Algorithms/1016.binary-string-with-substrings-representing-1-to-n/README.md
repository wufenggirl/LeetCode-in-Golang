# [1016. Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-string-with-substrings-representing-1-to-n/)

Given a binary string S (a string consisting only of '0' and '1's) and a positive integer N, return true if and only if for every integer X from 1 to N, the binary representation of X is a substring of S.

Example 1:

```text
Input: S = "0110", N = 3
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: S = "0110", N = 4
Output: false
```

Note:

- `1 <= S.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= N <= 10^9`
