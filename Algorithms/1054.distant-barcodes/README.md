# [1054. Distant Barcodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/distant-barcodes/)

In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the i-th barcode is barcodes[i].

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal.  You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2]
Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3,2,1,2,1]
```

Note:

1. `1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000`
1. `1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000`
