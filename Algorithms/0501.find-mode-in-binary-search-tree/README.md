# [501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/)

## 题目

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
1. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
1. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:

```text
Given BST [1,null,2,2],
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2

return [2].
```

Note:
If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up:
Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
