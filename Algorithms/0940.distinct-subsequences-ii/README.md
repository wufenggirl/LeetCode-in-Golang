# [940. Distinct Subsequences II](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/)

Given a string S, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of S .

Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

```text
Input: "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa" and "aba".
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
```

Note:

1. `S contains only lowercase letters.`
1. `1 <= S.length <= 2000`
