# [900. RLE Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/rle-iterator/)

## 题目

Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoding of some `sequence.` More specifically, for all even `i, A[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i+1]` is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function:`next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n` elements (`n >= 1`) and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.

For example, we start with `A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]`, which is a run-length encoding of the sequence `[8,8,8,5,5]`. This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".

Example 1:

```text
Input: ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
Explanation:
RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.
```

Note:

- 0 <= A.length <= 1000
- A.length`is an even integer.
- 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
- There are at most 1000 calls to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` per test case.
- Each call to `RLEIterator.next(int n)` will have 1 <= n <= 10^9.
