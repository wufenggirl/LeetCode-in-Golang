# [290. Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/)

## 题目

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Examples:

```text
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
```

Notes:
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.
