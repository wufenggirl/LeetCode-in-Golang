# [491. Increasing Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-subsequences/)

## 题目

Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing subsequence should be at least 2 .

Example:

```text
Input: [4, 6, 7, 7]
Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]
```

Note:

1. The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
1. The range of integer in the given array is [-100,100].
1. The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.
