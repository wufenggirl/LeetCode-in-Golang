# [91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

```text
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```

Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:

```text
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```
