# [673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)

## 题目

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```

Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
